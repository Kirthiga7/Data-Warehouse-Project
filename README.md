# Data-Warehouse-Project
**Data Warehouse**

A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision making process.
It includes
- ETL Processing
- Data Architecture
- Data Integration
- Data Cleansing
- Data Load
- Data Modeling

# ETL Processing

**Extract (E)** : Data is retrieved from various sources like databases
- Method: Pull Extraction
- Type: Full Extraction 
- Technique: File Parsing

**Transform (T)** – Data is cleansed, formatted, and structured before loading

It includes Data enrichment, Data integration, Derived column, Data normalization & standardization, Business rules& logic and Data aggregation.

Data Cleansing include remove duplicates, data filtering, data type casting, handling missing data, invalid values and unwanted spaces.

**Load (L)** – The transformed data is loaded into a data warehouse
- Processing type: Batch processing
- Load method: Full load - Truncate and Insert
- Slowly Changing Simensions(SCD) - SCD1-overwrite(updating the content of data warehouse)

Between Source and Target We have multiple layers depend on building the data warehouse

# Data Architecture

Data Architecture is the blueprint that defines how data is collected, stored, processed, and used within an organization.

It ensures data is organized, secure, and accessible for analytics, decision-making, and operational processes.

Type: Data Warehouse

Approach: Medallion Architecture
